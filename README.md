# Why Long Island Rail Roadâ€™s record on-time performance tells only half the story
### More trains arrive on or close to schedule, but service issues are far from over.

As New York City rolls out its congestion pricing program, state officials are encouraging Long Island commuters to shift from driving to using the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). LIRR leadership touts record on-time performance rates, but a deeper look into state data and rider experiences reveals a more complex picture. While trains ran on time more often in 2024 than in any previous non-pandemic year, the total number of delayed trains remains higher than in 2022 due to increased service and ongoing infrastructure issues. Riders continue to deal with operational hiccups â€” like missed transfers at Jamaica Station and persistent equipment problems â€” even as the system expands. 

Meanwhile, fare increases loom, leaving commuters frustrated by rising costs despite modest service improvements. The story examines the gap between official performance metrics and the everyday experience of riders navigating a changing transit landscape.

# Methodology 
To understand where the number of English Language Learner students is growing fastest in New York City, I analyzed enrollment data released by the cityâ€™s Department of Education.

The information comes from the DOEâ€™s Demographic Snapshot, a dataset that includes demographic and enrollment figures for every public school in the city. I focused on a subset of the data that tracks ELL enrollment at the school level across recent academic years.

The file â€” downloaded in April 2025 â€” includes data up through the 2023â€“24 school year. The analysis compared enrollment from 2022â€“23 to 2023â€“24 to identify which schools saw the biggest increase in the number of ELL students, regardless of school size using percent change.

To perform the analysis, the data was cleaned and reformatted using Python and the Pandas library. I filtered the file to retain only the relevant fields: school name, year, total enrollment, and the number and percentage of ELL students. A new column was added to extract the starting year of each school year (e.g., 2022 for 2022â€“23) to simplify comparisons.

After isolating the two most recent years, I calculated the year-over-year change in the number of ELL students at each school. Schools were ranked based on the highest percent change in ELL students, and the 10 schools with the largest jumps were selected.

One outlier, Olympus Academy, was excluded from the final results. While the school technically saw a 700% increase in ELL enrollment â€” from one student in 2022â€“23 to eight in 2023â€“24 â€” the change was not statistically significant compared to the much larger increases at other schools. To maintain the integrity of the findings, only schools with meaningful absolute gains were considered.

The analysis does not account for percentage growth or longer-term trends. Schools with missing data for either of the two years were excluded, as were schools with no change or a decrease in ELL enrollment. The dataset includes both traditional public and charter schools, but no distinction was made between them.
Factors such as changes in classification, policy shifts, or new program rollouts may also influence ELL counts beyond student movement alone. While the data offers insight into recent shifts, it may not capture the full picture of why certain schools saw rapid growth.
