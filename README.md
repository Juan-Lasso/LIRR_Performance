# Why Long Island Rail Road‚Äôs record on-time performance tells only half the story
### More trains arrive on or close to schedule, but service issues are far from over.

As New York City rolls out its congestion pricing program, state officials are encouraging Long Island commuters to shift from driving to using the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR). LIRR leadership touts record on-time performance rates, but a deeper look into state data and rider experiences reveals a more complex picture. While trains ran on time more often in 2024 than in any previous non-pandemic year, the total number of delayed trains remains higher than in 2022 due to increased service and ongoing infrastructure issues. Riders continue to deal with operational hiccups ‚Äî like missed transfers at Jamaica Station and persistent equipment problems ‚Äî even as the system expands. 

Meanwhile, fare increases loom, leaving commuters frustrated by rising costs despite modest service improvements. The story examines the gap between official performance metrics and the everyday experience of riders navigating a changing transit landscape.

# Methodology 
To dig into the LIRR‚Äôs on-time performance, I started by downloading the raw train delay data from the New York State Open Data portal. Using Google Sheets, I cleaned the data down to the essentials ‚Äî keeping only Service Date, Status, Minutes Late, and Delay Category. Then, I broke the data out by year and created pivot tables to count how often each cause of delay appeared, giving a clear picture of what was driving lateness over the past three years.

It‚Äôs important to note a few caveats here. The LIRR‚Äôs official ‚Äúon-time‚Äù standard allows a grace period of up to six minutes, meaning delays shorter than that don‚Äôt count ‚Äî so the data doesn‚Äôt capture those smaller, yet frustrating, wait times commuters often experience. Also, the increase in train volume, especially after the opening of Grand Central Madison, makes the system more complex; more trains mean more opportunities for delays, even if the overall on-time percentage improves.

By comparing years, I could see how operational challenges like scheduling conflicts, slow boarding, and train door malfunctions contributed heavily to delays ‚Äî problems largely within LIRR‚Äôs control. Meanwhile, infrastructure maintenance and aging equipment also played big roles. The data showed that while trains ran more punctually overall, the average length of delays didn‚Äôt really get shorter, holding steady around 11 to 12 minutes.
